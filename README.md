Bellabeat manufactures smart devices that can track an individual’s activity, sleep, stress, mindfulness, and reproductive health habits. Combined with their companion Bellabeat app and subscription-based membership model, these products deliver personalized data and guidance to meet a user’s current lifestyle and desired goals. More recently in 2016, Bellabeat released multiple new products (Leaf, Time, and Spring) and expanded its’ offices around the world. Bellabeat products are available through a number of online retailers and displayed extensively in digital marketing platforms such as Google, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, YouTube, etc.

#### Recommendations:
- Campaign with a health organization like the CDC for educating users on what daily metrics can contribute to a healthy, active lifestyle and encourage them to set goals on the Bellabeat app.

- Smart device active metrics are passively tracked on a frequent basis. Non-active metrics like sleep and weight could have a notification on a user's device or an incentive on the Bellabeat app for users to manually input data more frequently.

- Target middle of the week (Tuesday/Wednesday) and the hours between 12-2pm, 5-7pm for user notifications and incentives on the Bellabeat app.

- Users should be able to see a more complete daily end of the day total that is a passive sum of hourly or minute metrics. Daily active metrics on the Bellabeat app need to be tracked more consistently on top of existing hourly and minute metrics to establish a better understanding of the relationship between daily active metrics and daily passive metrics such as sleep and weight.
