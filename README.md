#### Background:
Founded in 2013 by artist Urška Sršen and mathematician Sando Mur, Bellabeat is a health and wellness technology company that seeks to inform, inspire, and empower women to make health-conscious decisions. Bellabeat manufactures smart devices that can track an individual’s activity, sleep, stress, mindfulness, and reproductive health habits. Combined with their companion Bellabeat app and subscription-based membership model, these products deliver personalized data and guidance to meet a user’s current lifestyle and desired goals. More recently in 2016, Bellabeat released multiple new products (Leaf, Time, and Spring) and expanded its’ offices around the world. Bellabeat products are available through a number of online retailers and displayed extensively in digital marketing platforms such as Google, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, YouTube, etc. 

#### Purpose:
The goal of this project is to find opportunities for growth in current and future markets by using smart device usage data to deliver insights that can drive strategical innovation for Bellabeat to have a greater global presence. Identifying trends in non-Bellabeat smart device usage will help Bellabeat customers and its marketing strategists. After identifying these trends, the project will study the relationship of non-Bellabeat user habits to a Bellabeat product’s tracking capabilities and then form recommendations that meet the needs of potential users. These recommendations include updates to the Bellabeat app and product design enhancements that would be most useful for driving consumer demand and retention.  Each recommendation will also include cost estimates for changes and potential profit margins. The final deliverables will include a clear summary of the business task, a description of all data sources used, documentation of any cleaning or manipulation of data, a summary of analysis, supporting visualizations and key findings, and recommendations based on analysis.
